# Good-reads-PowerBi-Dashbaord
The dataset included over 1 million reviews from 13,000+ books, scraped from public Goodreads shelves in late 2017. 
What I worked with:
 "Works" table – metadata like author, genre, publication year, ratings etc.
 "Reviews" table – raw English text reviews (spoiler flags included!)
The challenge required me to use the data to build a custom summer reading list tailored to any reader’s unique taste.
My approach:
 ~I focused on creating a visually engaging and user-friendly dashboard by designing both a light-themed and dark-themed version.
 ~To make navigation seamless, I added a toggle button that lets users switch between the two themes in a single click — because your data experience should be as flexible as your reading mood!
